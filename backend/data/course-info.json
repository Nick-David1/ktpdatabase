      "content": "This course introduces freshmen to a set of design-oriented engineering skills through a hands-on experience using engineering tools (software and hardware) for design and prototyping. Students will be exposed to a number of mechanical and electrical engineering tools applicable to 3D visualization, building structures, designing and wiring circuits, prototyping and instrumentation. Students will work individually and in teams to build substructures that can be integrated into a functional device (final product)."
