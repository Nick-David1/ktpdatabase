The course  delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual  privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all  around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism,  entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they  gain in this class to enhance those interests.

We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's   biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to   engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine   the computational approach. Students will work with published data and   computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology   implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research   questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative   mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each   paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a   report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a   critical review of a broader topic in the field.

The goal of the course is to  give students exposure to, and practical experience in, formulating data science  questions -- particularly learning how to ask good questions in a specific  domain.  The course will also cover methods of obtaining data and common methods  of processing data from a practical standpoint. It will be organized around a  semester-long group project in which students are organized into teams and  engage with \"clients\" who bring data science questions from a particular domain.    The course will include a formal presentation of results at the end of the  semester.",

            "content": "Experience with translational or applied research pursued in an industrial or  laboratory setting is important for in-the-field graduate training. To provide  this training, graduate students may complete a lab rotation that provides them  with the opportunity to (1) explore lab settings and industrial collaborations  that may be relevant to their thesis work; (2) experience the diversity of  applied and in-the-field research styles in computing and data sciences; and (3)  expand their external network of potential research collaborators. Before  beginning an external lab rotation, students are expected to develop a plan for  the scope and expected outcomes of the work to be pursued under the supervision  of a named lab rotation advisor. This plan must be pre-approved by the student's  academic, research, or thesis advisor in CDS. While desirable, it is neither  required nor expected that the rotation will result in completion of a  substantial body of work. Lab rotation credits will be noted on the student  transcript as a 4-credit pass/fail independent study course numbered as DS-990.",

            "content": "Experience with diverse research group projects and styles are an essential part   of graduate training. To provide this training, graduate students are expected   to complete a series of research rotations that provide them with the   opportunity to (1) explore research groups where they may pursue future thesis   work; (2) experience the diversity of sub-disciplines and research styles in   computing and data sciences; and (3) expand their network of potential research   collaborators. Before beginning a rotation, students are expected to discuss   their plans with the faculty leadership of the BU research group they would like   to join, leading to a clear definition of the scope and expected outcomes of the   work pursued under the supervision of a named rotation advisor. While desirable,   it is neither required nor expected that the rotation will result in completion   of a substantial body of work. Research rotation credits will be noted on the   student transcript as a 4-credit independent study course numbered as DS-991   (for Fall semester rotations) or DS-992 (for Spring semester rotations).",
