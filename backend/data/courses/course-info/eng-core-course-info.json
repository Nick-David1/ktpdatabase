The ideas   and tools you will learn are immensely useful in a wide variety of application   domains, including physics, engineering, big data, data visualization, and   more. You will become familiar with vectors and matrices, linear systems of   equations, vector spaces, inner products, eigenvectors and eigenvalues and the   more general singular values. You will also learn to interpret matrices as   linear transformations and to understand the geometrical interpretation for   operations such as solving linear systems of equations and least-squares   fitting of data to models. Throughout the course, the tools will be related to   specific applications to show how linear algebra is used to solve real-world   problems. Examples include Google's PageRank algorithm, cryptography, coding   theory, genetics, bioinformatics, image compression, linear programming   (optimization), networks, and Markov chains.
